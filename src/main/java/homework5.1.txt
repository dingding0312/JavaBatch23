What is lock?
Lock is a interface and Java lock acts as thread synchronization mechanisms that are similar to the synchronized blocks.

Future: represents the result of an asynchronous computation. When the asynchronous task is created, a Java Future object is returned. 
This Future object functions as a handle to the result of the asynchronous task. Once the asynchronous task completes, 
the result can be accessed via the Future object returned when the task was started.

CompletableFuture:
A CompltableFuture is used for asynchronous programming. Asynchronous programming means writing non-blocking code. 
It runs a task on a separate thread than the main application thread and notifies the main thread about its progress, completion or failure.
